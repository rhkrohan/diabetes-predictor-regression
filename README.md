# Diabetes Prediction Analysis 
## Introduction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using various regression techniques. The dataset includes 16 symptoms as features and is sourced from a reliable dataset on Kaggle. The data preprocessing is performed using modules from the sklearn library.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20 (train
). Multiple regression models are trained on the training data and their performance is evaluated using the RÂ² score and a custom accuracy function, which calculates the percentage of correctly predicted results.

The models applied in this project are:

1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

The performance of each model is thoroughly analyzed to determine the most effective technique for predicting diabetes based on the given symptoms.
